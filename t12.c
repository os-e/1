Allocation methods are the ways of storing files on a disk or other storage media. 
  hey affect how the files are assigned to physical storage locations, how the space is managed, and how the files are accessed. 


- **Contiguous Allocation:** 
  This method stores each file in a continuous block of free space on the disk.
  This means that all the data for a file is stored in one section of the disk, without any gaps. 
The advantage of this method is that it provides fast access to files, especially for sequential access, as the disk head only needs to move to the starting address of the file and read the entire file sequentially.
The disadvantage of this method is that it can lead to fragmentation, which is the problem of having gaps or fragments of free space scattered throughout the disk, making it difficult to find a large enough contiguous block for new files. 
  Fragmentation can also waste disk space, as some blocks may be partially filled or unused.

- **Linked Allocation:** This method stores each file in non-contiguous blocks of free space on the disk, and links them together using pointers.
This means that the data for a file can be stored in multiple blocks that are not adjacent to each other, and each block contains the address of the next block in the file.
The advantage of this method is that it can accommodate files of any size, as the file can be stored in any available free space on the disk, without the need to find a contiguous block. 
  This method also avoids fragmentation, as there are no gaps between the blocks.
  The disadvantage of this method is that it can result in slower access times to files, especially for direct access, as the disk head needs to follow the chain of pointers to access the entire file. This method may also require more disk space, as each block contains a pointer to the next block in the file.

- **File-Allocation Table (FAT):** This method uses a table at the beginning of each volume or partition that contains the information about the blocks occupied by each file.
  This means that the data for a file can be stored in non-contiguous blocks, but the table keeps track of the order and location of the blocks. 
  The advantage of this method is that it is efficient for sequential access, as the table can quickly locate the blocks of a file.
  The disadvantage of this method is that it may result in disk head seeks, which are the movements of the disk head to different locations on the disk, as the blocks of a file may not be close to each other.

- **Indexed Allocation:** This method uses a special block for each file, called the index block, that contains the pointers to the data blocks of the file.
  This means that the data for a file can be stored in non-contiguous blocks, but the index block keeps track of the order and location of the blocks.
  The advantage of this method is that it supports direct access without external fragmentation, as the index block can quickly locate the blocks of a file. The disadvantage of this method is that it requires index block overhead, which is the extra space needed to store the index block for each file. 
This method may also suffer from wasted space, as some blocks may be partially filled or unused.





Certainly! Here are summarized notes from the provided information:

### Magnetic Disks:
- **Structure:** Flat circular platters covered with magnetic material.
- **Components:** Read-write heads, disk arm, tracks, sectors, cylinders.
- **Operation:** Spins at high speed, read-write heads move on an arm.
- **Issues:** Risk of head crash damaging the magnetic surface.

### Solid-State Disks (SSDs):
- **Characteristics:** Nonvolatile memory, no moving parts, faster, and more reliable.
- **Variations:** DRAM, flash-memory technologies (SLC, MLC).
- **Advantages:** Faster, no seek time, no latency, lower power consumption.
- **Limitations:** More expensive, less capacity, shorter lifespan.

### Disk Structure:
- **Logical Blocks:** Addressed as one-dimensional arrays, logical block size typically 512 bytes.
- **Mapping:** Logical blocks mapped onto disk sectors sequentially.
- **Translation Challenges:** Defective sectors hidden, sectors per track not constant.

### Disk Attachment:
#### Host-Attached Storage:
- **Technologies:** IDE, ATA, SATA, fibre channel (FC).
- **Devices:** Hard disk drives, RAID arrays, CD, DVD, and tape drives.
- **Commands:** Reads and writes of logical data blocks.

#### Network-Attached Storage (NAS):
- **Access:** Remotely over a data network.
- **Protocols:** NFS for UNIX, CIFS for Windows, iSCSI.
- **Efficiency:** Less efficient, lower performance compared to direct-attached storage.

#### Storage-Area Network (SAN):
- **Private Network:** Connects servers and storage units.
- **Flexibility:** Multiple hosts and storage arrays, dynamic storage allocation.
- **Interconnects:** FC, iSCSI, InfiniBand.
